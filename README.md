This API is helpful if you're looking for information about the Zelda games.
First order of business is letting you know this is a free API that was not created by me, but some nice developers who have asked politely not to spam it and keeping it a free service
Second order of business, some information may not be entirely accurate or a little broken as it's been scraped from fandom sites
Third order of business this search functionality has been developed so case sensitivity is no longer required making the user experience slightly better
Fourth retrieving information from search results may give you some nice information but might not always link to the actual game.. no pun intended
Fifth, this was created for learning purposes and mission accomplished

Some areas that were troublesome during development, were the case sensitivity during searching
As well displaying results, not too far down on the page having information displayed in a manner that is readable and organized

Realizing some people may not be as familiar with Zelda as others, I created an area for users to get the ball rolling, prompting them on a few popular items in each category.

If I were to continue developing this deeper, creating a richer experience, I would remove the search assistant -not sure where to start- so that after you hit the search button your results replaced everything I would also make the entire results cards clickable to move onto the details as for now it's just the button that is clickable I would also add more animation and possibly include animation directly related to Zelda franchise

I use the knowledge that was taught in Web scripting II to begin this project from the basics. Functionality is key to a good user experience. I used AI to help with styling as the purpose of this project was more mechanical. Experimenting with different styling properties is something that I continue to tweak on my own after a base was laid. 



If you have skipped over the long block a text and you're wondering how to use this. Please start at the home screen and begin searching for one of the items that is listed in the suggestion section.

If you see something you like, you can add to the favourites by clicking on the save two selection option

If you want to view your favorites, you can do so in the top right corner and if you feel like removing something from your favorites, there is a trash icon for you to click on






Thank you to the creators of the Zelda API and thank you to Nintendo and all of the amazing creators over there that have given me so many amazing memories as a child spending hours in days and weeks lost in the world you've created. If you ever stumble across this, please consider it a token of gratitude towards all of your hard work, and by no means am I trying to take Credit or replicate anything that you have done. Cheers. 作ってくれてありがとうございます# zelda-api
